This folder contains practice projects done through freeCodeCamp.com in order to provide experience with HTML and CSS. These are all guided projects and unlike the certification projects in which I was only provided a list of directives to fufill, these were built with step by step instructions until completion in order to gain exposure and experience with the languages.
